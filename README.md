ACCORDION
This is a version of solitaire.  To win the game, there should be no cards left in the deck and you should only have one face-up pile of cards.  Cards are dealt from the the deck as you ask for them, until no cards are left.  At any time, you may move the last card dealt onto a previous card according to the following rules:
1. The cards must match in rank or in suit
2. You may only move onto the previous card or onto the card that is three positions back.
For example, if your first four cards are:
Jack of Spades, Three of Diamonds, Three of Clubs, Three of Spades the Three of Spades may be moved on top of the Three of Clubs or the Jack of Spades.
